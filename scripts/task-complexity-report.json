      "taskTitle": "Migrate D3.js Visualizations",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the D3.js visualization migration into subtasks covering component architecture, rendering lifecycle, responsive design, performance optimization, interaction handling, accessibility, and testing. For each subtask, include specific technical requirements and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "D3.js is a complex library that requires direct DOM manipulation, which can be challenging to integrate with React's virtual DOM. This task involves creating reusable visualization components that handle responsive design, user interactions, and proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks. The complexity is high due to the need to manage D3's imperative approach within React's declarative paradigm."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the parameter controls implementation into subtasks covering UI component creation, state management, validation, optimistic updates, and undo/redo functionality. For each subtask, provide specific requirements and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating interactive controls that update visualizations in real-time, requiring careful state management, debouncing for performance, and optimistic UI updates. The undo/redo functionality adds complexity, as it requires maintaining a history of state changes."
    },

      "taskId": 19,
      "taskTitle": "Implement External API Integrations",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the external API integrations task into subtasks covering API client creation, authentication, rate limiting, error handling, caching, and testing for each external service (Todoist, OpenAI, Notion). For each subtask, include specific requirements and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating with multiple external APIs requires handling different authentication methods, rate limits, and response formats. The task involves creating robust error handling, implementing caching strategies, and ensuring the application gracefully handles API failures or rate limiting."
