# Demand Planning Dashboard - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
This project implements a demand planning dashboard using a hybrid cloud architecture with Next.js on Vercel for the frontend and AWS infrastructure for backend services. The dashboard enables hierarchical forecast visualization and adjustments using D3.js for data visualization. The system uses Neon (serverless Postgres) for database operations, AWS services for authentication and data processing, and Terraform for infrastructure as code.

## Goals
- Create an intuitive demand planning dashboard for forecast visualization and adjustment
- Enable multi-dimensional hierarchical data analysis (Geography, Product, Customer, Campaign)
- Provide real-time collaborative forecast adjustments with audit trails
- Implement scalable cloud architecture with serverless components
- Ensure high performance and cost optimization
- Support data export and integration with external systems

## User Stories
- As a demand planner, I want to visualize forecasts at different hierarchy levels to understand demand patterns
- As a demand planner, I want to make percentage or absolute adjustments to forecasts with immediate visual feedback
- As a demand planner, I want to see adjustment history to understand who made changes and why
- As a sales manager, I want to export forecast data for reporting and analysis
- As a sales manager, I want to drill down from regional to customer-specific forecasts
- As an admin, I want to manage user permissions and access controls
- As a data analyst, I want to compare multiple forecast scenarios side by side
- As a user, I want the dashboard to load quickly and respond instantly to interactions

## Functional Requirements
- Hierarchical data visualization with D3.js charts (line charts, comparison views)
- Multi-level filtering: Geography (Region > Market > Submarket), Product (Category > Subcategory > Item), Customer (Type > Group > Account), Campaign
- Time period controls: Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly views with custom date ranges
- Adjustment capabilities: Percentage-based or absolute value modifications
- Adjustment history tracking with timestamps, user attribution, and comments
- Data export functionality (CSV, Excel, JSON formats)
- User authentication and role-based access control
- Real-time updates when multiple users are viewing the same data
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet devices
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Page load under 2 seconds, chart updates under 100ms
- Scalability: Support 100+ concurrent users, handle datasets with millions of rows
- Security: SOC2 compliant, encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Availability: 99.9% uptime SLA
- Browser Support: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Monitoring: Real-time error tracking and performance metrics
- Disaster Recovery: Automated backups, point-in-time recovery
- Cost Optimization: Serverless architecture to minimize idle costs

## Architecture Components

### Frontend (Vercel)
- Next.js 14 with App Router and React Server Components
- D3.js for interactive data visualizations
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Zustand for state management
- Vercel hosting with edge functions

### Database (Neon)
- Serverless PostgreSQL for primary data storage
- Database branching for preview environments
- Connection pooling for efficiency
- Optimized schema for time-series data
- Automated migrations

### Backend (AWS)
- API Gateway HTTP API for RESTful endpoints
- Lambda functions for business logic
- Cognito for authentication
- S3 for file storage
- Athena for analytics queries
- DynamoDB for caching
- CloudWatch for monitoring

### Infrastructure (Terraform)
- Modular IaC approach
- Environment-based configurations
- Automated deployments
- Security best practices
- Cost allocation tags

## Out of Scope
- Mobile native applications (responsive web only)
- Offline functionality
- Machine learning forecasting (integration-ready but not implemented)
- ERP system integration (API-ready but not implemented)
- Multi-language support (English only initially)
- Custom report builder
- Email notifications
- Data warehousing

## Logical Dependency Chain
1. AWS account setup and Terraform initialization
2. Core infrastructure provisioning (VPC, IAM, S3)
3. Database setup (Neon configuration and schema)
4. Authentication system (Cognito user pools)
5. API Gateway and Lambda functions
6. Frontend development environment
7. Core UI components and layouts
8. D3.js visualization components
9. API integration and data flow
10. User management features
11. Export functionality
12. Performance optimization
13. Security hardening
14. Monitoring and alerting
15. Documentation and deployment
