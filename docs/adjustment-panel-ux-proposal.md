# Adjustment Panel UX Redesign Proposal

## Executive Summary

This proposal addresses the current UX challenges in the LTO Demand Planning adjustment panel and presents a comprehensive redesign that integrates the adjustment workflow seamlessly into the main plotting interface. The goal is to create a more intuitive, accessible, and efficient user experience that encourages data-driven decision making.

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
1. **Visual Isolation**: The adjustment panel is visually separated from the data it affects, requiring users to mentally map their actions to chart changes
2. **Scrolling Friction**: Confined box layout forces unnecessary scrolling, hiding important context
3. **Visual Inconsistency**: Dark grey background creates visual discord with the light theme
4. **Label Confusion**: Inconsistent terminology between "adjustment," "forecast adjustment," and percentage values
5. **Hidden Affordances**: Collapsible sections hide critical functionality
6. **Z-index Issues**: Filter dropdowns get buried under other elements

### User Journey Friction
- Users must navigate between multiple panels to complete a single adjustment
- The relationship between filters and adjustments isn't immediately apparent
- Limited visual feedback during the adjustment process

## Proposed Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Contextual Integration**: Adjustments should feel like a natural extension of data exploration
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show relevant controls when needed, hide complexity when not
3. **Direct Manipulation**: Users should feel they're directly modifying the chart
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Every action should have instant visual response
5. **Clarity Over Density**: Prioritize understanding over information density

## Detailed Design Recommendations

### 1. Floating Adjustment Toolbar

**Concept**: Replace the sidebar panel with a floating toolbar that appears above the chart when users interact with the data.

**Design Specifications**:
- **Position**: Horizontally centered, 24px below the chart title
- **Background**: Semi-transparent white (rgba(255,255,255,0.95)) with subtle backdrop blur
- **Border**: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.08) with 12px border radius
- **Shadow**: 0 4px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.12) for elevation
- **Padding**: 16px horizontal, 12px vertical

**Contents** (left to right):
1. Adjustment value display with large, clear typography
2. Slider control for fine adjustments (-50% to +50%)
3. Quick preset buttons (+5%, +10%, -5%, -10%)
4. Impact preview (e.g., "+2.3M units")
5. Save button with loading state

### 2. Integrated Filter Experience

**Concept**: Filters become floating pills directly above the chart, eliminating the need for a separate filter section.

**Design Specifications**:
- **Filter Pills**:
  - Height: 36px
  - Background: White with 1px border
  - Active state: Primary blue background with white text
  - Hover: Subtle shadow elevation
  - Click: Opens dropdown directly below with highest z-index (9999)

- **Layout**: Horizontal row with 8px gaps, wrapping on smaller screens
- **Interaction**: Single click to open, click outside or ESC to close
- **Multi-select**: Checkboxes within dropdown, with "Apply" button

### 3. Visual Hierarchy Improvements

**Primary Actions** (Highest Visual Weight):
- Save Adjustment button: Solid blue, larger size, prominent position
- Current adjustment value: 24px font size, bold weight

**Secondary Actions** (Medium Visual Weight):
- Filter pills: Clear borders, readable labels
- Preset adjustment buttons: Ghost style with blue text

**Tertiary Elements** (Lower Visual Weight):
- Historical adjustments: Subtle grey cards below chart
- Metadata: Smaller text, lighter colors

### 4. Micro-interactions and Feedback

**Adjustment Slider**:
- Smooth animation as value changes
- Chart updates in real-time with 100ms debounce
- Haptic-style visual "snap" at 0%, 5%, 10% intervals
- Color gradient from red (negative) through grey (0) to green (positive)

**Save Process**:
- Button transforms to show loading spinner
- Success: Brief green checkmark before returning to normal
- Error: Red shake animation with clear error message

**Filter Selection**:
- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- Selected items show checkmark with spring animation
- Clear visual distinction between selected/unselected states

### 5. Responsive Behavior

**Desktop (>1024px)**:
- Full floating toolbar with all controls visible
- Filter pills in single row
- Adjustment history sidebar on right

**Tablet (768-1024px)**:
- Floating toolbar remains full width
- Filter pills wrap to two rows if needed
- Adjustment history moves below chart

**Mobile (<768px)**:
- Adjustment toolbar becomes bottom sheet
- Filters become horizontally scrollable
- Swipe up to reveal adjustment history

### 6. Accessibility Enhancements

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- Tab order: Filters → Adjustment slider → Presets → Save button
- Arrow keys control slider in 1% increments
- Enter key saves adjustment
- Escape key cancels current adjustment

**Screen Reader Support**:
- Clear ARIA labels for all controls
- Live regions announce adjustment changes
- Descriptive labels for chart changes

**Visual Accessibility**:
- Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for all text
- Focus indicators with 3px outline
- Color-blind friendly palette for positive/negative indicators

### 7. New Feature Proposals

**Smart Suggestions**:
- AI-powered adjustment recommendations based on historical patterns
- "Similar periods had +X% adjustment" contextual hints
- Seasonal adjustment templates

**Collaborative Features**:
- Real-time cursors showing other users' adjustments
- Comment threads on specific adjustments
- Adjustment approval workflow for large changes

**Advanced Visualizations**:
- Before/after overlay on hover
- Confidence interval visualization for adjustments
- Impact distribution across sub-categories

## Implementation Priority
