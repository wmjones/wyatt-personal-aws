# Vercel Environment Variables Already Set

## Current Situation

The branch-specific environment variables for `feature/fix-database-auth` are already configured in Vercel:
- DATABASE_URL
- DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED
- DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH

## Quick Fix

Since the variables are already set, you can:

1. **Continue with the current deployment** - The workflow will show warnings but should still deploy successfully
2. **Manually verify the variables** are correct:
   ```bash
   vercel env ls preview | grep "feature/fix-database-auth"
   ```

## Why This Happened

The variables were likely set by:
- A previous workflow run
- Manual configuration in Vercel dashboard
- A previous deployment attempt

## Next Steps

1. **Check if your deployment is working** - Visit your preview URL and test the API endpoints
2. **If the database connection still fails**, verify the DATABASE_URL values:
   ```bash
   # Pull the environment for your branch
   cd src/frontend/nextjs-app
   vercel env pull .env.local --environment=preview --git-branch=feature/fix-database-auth

   # Check the values
   cat .env.local
   ```

3. **If values are incorrect**, remove and re-add them manually:
   ```bash
   # Remove old values
   vercel env rm DATABASE_URL preview feature/fix-database-auth --yes
   vercel env rm DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED preview feature/fix-database-auth --yes

   # Add new values
   echo "your-database-url" | vercel env add DATABASE_URL preview feature/fix-database-auth
   echo "your-database-url-unpooled" | vercel env add DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED preview feature/fix-database-auth
   ```

## Updated Workflow

The workflow has been updated to handle this scenario more gracefully - it will:
1. Attempt to remove existing variables
2. Add new values
3. Continue even if variables already exist

This prevents the workflow from failing when variables are already configured.
