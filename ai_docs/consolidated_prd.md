# Overview
The D3 Dashboard & Productivity System is a comprehensive serverless application that combines two powerful components:

1. An **Interactive D3 Visualization Dashboard** that allows users to create, view, and collaboratively edit data visualizations with real-time updates.

2. A **Productivity Workflow System** that automates the process of enriching Todoist tasks with AI-generated content from ChatGPT and organizing them in Notion.

This solution addresses the challenges of creating interactive data visualizations and automating productivity workflows between popular tools. It helps data analysts, business intelligence teams, and project managers streamline their work through a modern, scalable platform built entirely on AWS serverless technologies.

  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple visualization types, use existing libraries where possible, create reusable components

## MVP Scoping
- **Risk**: Trying to implement too many features may delay initial release
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on core visualization functionality first, prioritize features based on user value

- **Risk**: Complexity of full productivity workflow may be overwhelming
  - **Mitigation**: Start with simple Todoist-to-Notion integration, add ChatGPT processing later

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: AWS costs may escalate with heavy usage
  - **Mitigation**: Implement proper IAM policies, cost monitoring, and alerting; optimize Lambda functions for performance
