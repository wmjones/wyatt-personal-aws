# Project Overview: D3 Dashboard (Hybrid Architecture)

## Executive Summary

This project implements a hybrid architecture for the D3 Dashboard, combining Vercel's modern frontend hosting capabilities with AWS's robust backend infrastructure. This approach allows us to leverage the best of both platforms while avoiding costly migrations and maintaining proven infrastructure.

## Architecture Overview

### Hybrid Architecture Design

The system is split into two distinct deployment targets:

1. **Frontend (Vercel)**
   - Next.js 14 application with TypeScript
   - Server-side rendering with React Server Components
   - Automatic deployments from GitHub
   - Global edge network distribution via Vercel
   - Preview environments for each branch

2. **Backend (AWS)**
   - Lambda functions for API endpoints
   - DynamoDB for data persistence
   - API Gateway for HTTP/WebSocket connections
   - Cognito for authentication
   - S3 for data storage and file uploads

### Integration Points

- **API Communication**: Frontend connects to AWS backend via API Gateway endpoints
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito handles user auth with JWT tokens
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections through API Gateway
- **File Storage**: S3 for user uploads and data exports

## System Components

### D3 Visualization Dashboard

The dashboard provides interactive data visualizations with real-time collaboration:

- **Frontend Features**:
  - Interactive D3.js visualizations
  - Drag-and-drop parameter adjustment
  - Dark mode support
  - Responsive design
  - Real-time collaboration indicators

- **Backend Services**:
  - Parameter storage in DynamoDB
  - WebSocket connections for real-time updates
  - History tracking for all changes
  - User-specific data isolation

## Development Approach

### Terraform Modules First

The AWS infrastructure follows a modular approach:

- Community modules from `terraform-aws-modules`
- Reusable custom modules for common patterns
- Environment-based configurations
- Version-controlled infrastructure

### Frontend Development

The Next.js frontend leverages:

- App Router for improved performance
- Server Components where applicable
- Client Components for interactivity
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

## Environment Strategy

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   - Next.js dev server on port 3000
   - Environment variables for AWS endpoints
   - Local testing against AWS backend

2. **Preview Deployments**
   - Automatic Vercel previews for PRs
   - Isolated testing environments
   - CORS configured for preview URLs

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Main branch deploys to production
   - Custom domain configuration
   - Full monitoring and alerting

### Environment Variables

Frontend requires configuration for:
- AWS API Gateway endpoints
- Cognito user pool details
- WebSocket connection URLs
- Feature flags

## Benefits of Hybrid Approach

### Technical Benefits

1. **Best of Both Platforms**
   - Vercel's superior frontend DX
   - AWS's proven backend infrastructure
   - Independent scaling capabilities
   - Flexible deployment strategies

2. **Cost Optimization**
   - No data migration costs
   - Leverages existing AWS investments
   - Optimized frontend hosting costs
   - Pay-per-use backend services

3. **Risk Mitigation**
   - No "big bang" migration
   - Gradual feature rollout possible
   - Easy rollback mechanisms
   - Maintains system stability

### Operational Benefits

1. **Developer Experience**
   - Modern frontend tooling
   - Automatic preview environments
   - Fast deployment cycles
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Maintenance**
   - Independent frontend/backend updates
   - Isolated troubleshooting
   - Separate monitoring systems
   - Reduced complexity
