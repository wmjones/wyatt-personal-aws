name: Deploy Next.js to Vercel with Branch-based Neon Setup

# This workflow creates Neon database branches for each branch deployment
# and passes the connection strings to Vercel during deployment
#
# IMPORTANT: Database URLs are passed as build-time environment variables
# to ensure each branch deployment uses its own dedicated Neon branch.
# This prevents conflicts when multiple feature branches are deployed.
