# Date Range Filter Issue Analysis and Fix

## Issue Identified

The date range filters ARE being set correctly in the initial state, but they appear not to be applied because:

1. The forecast query is disabled (`enabled: params.itemIds.length > 0`) until an inventory item is selected
2. When the page first loads, no inventory item is selected, so no API call is made
3. The auto-select inventory item effect runs asynchronously
4. Only after an inventory item is selected does the query become enabled and fire

This is actually **working as designed** - the query waits for an inventory item before fetching data.

## Root Cause

The perceived issue is that:
- The date range IS included in the initial state (`dateRange: { startDate: '2025-01-01', endDate: '2025-03-31' }`)
- The date range IS passed to the query when it fires
- But the query doesn't fire until an inventory item is selected

## Verification Steps

1. Check the Network tab in browser DevTools
2. Look for the POST request to `/api/data/postgres-forecast`
3. Inspect the request body - it should include the date range in the filters

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Keep Current Behavior (Recommended)
This is actually the correct behavior. The app waits for an inventory item before fetching data, which prevents unnecessary API calls.

### Option 2: Pre-select First Inventory Item in Initial State
If you want data to load immediately, you could fetch and set the first inventory item during server-side rendering or in the initial state.

### Option 3: Show Loading State More Clearly
Make it clearer to users that the app is waiting for inventory item selection before loading data.

## Code Flow Summary

1. Page loads with date range set to Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2025
2. No inventory item selected â†’ Query disabled
3. `useEffect` fetches inventory items
4. First inventory item auto-selected
5. Query becomes enabled and fires WITH the date range
6. Data loads with correct date filtering

The date range filters ARE working correctly on initial load!
