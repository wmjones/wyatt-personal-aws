# Filter Integration with D3 Chart

## Overview
The demand planning dashboard now integrates the filter selections from the sidebar with the D3 line plot visualization. Users can filter forecast data by States, DMAs, and DC IDs, and the chart will automatically update to show aggregated results.

## Implementation

### Data Structure Updates
**ForecastDataPoint** interface extended with filter fields:
```typescript
interface ForecastDataPoint {
  periodId: string;
  value: number;
  inventoryItemId?: string;
  state?: string;      // US state abbreviation
  dmaId?: string;      // 3-letter DMA code
  dcId?: string;       // DC integer ID as string
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

### Filter Integration Flow

1. **Data Generation**:
   - `useForecast` hook generates baseline data for all combinations of inventory items, states, DMAs, and DC IDs
   - Creates manageable data size: 8 items × 5 states × 3 DMAs/state × 2 DCs/DMA = reasonable combinations

2. **Filter Application**:
   - Hook receives `filterSelections` from the sidebar
   - Filters baseline data where data points match ALL active filter criteria
   - If no filters are selected, shows all data

3. **Chart Aggregation**:
   - `createChartDataset` function aggregates filtered data by time period
   - Multiple data points for the same period (from different states/DMAs/DCs) are summed
   - Chart displays total forecast values for selected filter combinations

### Filter Logic
```typescript
const stateMatch = states.length === 0 || states.includes(dataPoint.state || '');
const dmaMatch = dmaIds.length === 0 || dmaIds.includes(dataPoint.dmaId || '');
const dcMatch = dcIds.length === 0 || dcIds.includes(dataPoint.dcId || '');
return stateMatch && dmaMatch && dcMatch;
```

### Real-Time Updates
- Filter changes trigger `useForecast` hook re-execution
- Chart automatically re-renders with new aggregated data
- Maintains inventory item filtering in addition to geographic/distribution filtering

## User Experience

### Filter Behavior
- **No filters**: Shows total forecast across all states, DMAs, and DCs
- **State filter**: Shows forecast only for selected states (aggregated across DMAs/DCs in those states)
- **Multiple filters**: Shows intersection of all selected filters
- **Inventory + filters**: Combines inventory item selection with geographic filtering

### Chart Updates
- **Smooth transitions**: D3 chart smoothly updates when filters change
- **Aggregated values**: Chart shows meaningful totals, not individual data points
- **Consistent scale**: Y-axis adjusts to filtered data range
- **Interactive features**: Zoom, brush, and confidence intervals work with filtered data

## Benefits

1. **Real-time filtering**: Immediate visual feedback when changing filter selections
2. **Meaningful aggregation**: Shows business-relevant totals across selected dimensions
3. **Flexible combinations**: Users can drill down by any combination of geographic and distribution filters
4. **Performance optimized**: Efficient data filtering and aggregation
5. **Consistent UX**: Filter behavior matches user expectations from modern dashboard applications
