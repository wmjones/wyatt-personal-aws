# Date Range Filter Investigation Summary

## Investigation Request
Investigate why date range filters aren't being applied to the forecast plot when the page initially loads.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Date Range Filters ARE Working Correctly**
The date range filters are actually being applied on initial load. The investigation revealed that:

- The initial state correctly sets the date range to `{ startDate: '2025-01-01', endDate: '2025-03-31' }`
- This date range is properly passed through the component hierarchy
- The API receives the date range parameters when the forecast query fires

### 2. **The Perceived Issue is Actually Expected Behavior**
What appears to be a "missing date range" is actually the query waiting for an inventory item:

```javascript
// In useForecastQuery.ts
enabled: params.itemIds.length > 0  // Query only fires when inventory item is selected
```

**Timeline of Events:**
1. Page loads with date range set but no inventory item selected
2. Query is disabled (no API call made yet)
3. `useEffect` fetches available inventory items
4. First inventory item is auto-selected
5. Query becomes enabled and fires WITH the date range included
6. Data loads with correct date filtering

### 3. **Code Flow Analysis**

#### Initial State (page.tsx)
```typescript
const [filterSelections, setFilterSelections] = useState<FilterSelections>({
  states: [],
  dmaIds: [],
  dcIds: [],
  inventoryItemId: null,
  dateRange: { startDate: '2025-01-01', endDate: '2025-03-31' }  // ✓ Date range is set
});
```

#### Query Parameters (useForecast.ts)
```typescript
const queryParams = {
  itemIds,
  startDate,  // ✓ Extracted from filterSelections.dateRange
  endDate,    // ✓ Extracted from filterSelections.dateRange
  states: filterSelections?.states || [],
  dmaIds: filterSelections?.dmaIds || [],
  dcIds: filterSelections?.dcIds || []
};
```

#### API Request (when inventory item is selected)
```json
{
  "action": "get_forecast_data",
  "filters": {
    "inventoryItemId": 101,
    "startDate": "2025-01-01",  // ✓ Date range included
    "endDate": "2025-03-31",    // ✓ Date range included
    "state": [],
    "dmaId": [],
    "dcId": []
  }
}
```

## Verification Methods Used

1. **Code Analysis**: Traced the data flow from initial state through to API calls
2. **Console Logging**: Added debug logs to track when and how the query fires
3. **Test Script**: Created a simulation showing the exact sequence of events

## Conclusion

**The date range filters are working correctly.** The system is designed to wait for an inventory item selection before fetching forecast data, which is the optimal behavior to prevent unnecessary API calls.

## Recommendations

If you want to change this behavior, consider these options:

1. **Keep Current Behavior** (Recommended)
   - Most efficient - only fetches data when all required parameters are available
   - Prevents unnecessary API calls

2. **Pre-select Inventory Item**
   - Fetch inventory items during SSR or in a parent component
   - Set the first item in the initial state

3. **Improve Loading State**
   - Make it clearer that the app is waiting for inventory item selection
   - Add a message like "Please select an inventory item to view forecast data"

## Files Examined

- `/app/demand-planning/page.tsx` - Initial state and auto-selection logic
- `/app/demand-planning/hooks/useForecast.ts` - Query parameter construction
- `/app/demand-planning/hooks/useForecastQuery.ts` - Query enabling logic
- `/app/services/forecast/queryFunctions.ts` - API call implementation
- `/app/api/data/postgres-forecast/route.ts` - Backend filter processing

## Debug Artifacts Created (and cleaned up)

- `DebugDateRangeFlow.tsx` - Component to visualize filter state
- `initial-date-range.test.tsx` - Test to verify behavior
- `test-initial-date-range.ts` - Script to demonstrate the flow
