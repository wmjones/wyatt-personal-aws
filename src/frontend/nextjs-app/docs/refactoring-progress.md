# Dashboard Refactoring Progress

## Completed Tasks

### âœ… Task 26.1: Audit Current Dashboard Codebase
- Created comprehensive audit report documenting all issues
- Identified key areas for improvement with severity levels
- Established refactoring priorities

### âœ… Task 26.2: Establish Component Library Architecture
- Created `/components/ui` directory structure
- Implemented design system with theme tokens
- Built foundational components:
  - **Button**: Versatile button with variants and states
  - **Card**: Container component with elevation styles
  - **LoadingState**: Consistent loading indicators
  - **ErrorState**: Error display with retry actions
  - **EmptyState**: Empty data states with actions
- Added utility functions for styling and formatting
- Created comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

### ðŸ”„ Task 26.3: Implement Reusable Dropdown Component System
This is the next priority as dropdowns have the most code duplication:
- Create BaseDropdown component with:
  - Click-outside detection
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Search functionality
  - Proper ARIA attributes
- Refactor SingleSelectFilter and MultiSelectFilter to use BaseDropdown
- Add Storybook documentation

### Future Tasks
- Task 26.4: Extract and Standardize Data Visualization Components
- Task 26.5: Implement Data Fetching and State Management Pattern
- Task 26.6: Refactor Dashboard Layout and Navigation
- Task 26.7: Standardize Filter and Data Table Components
- Task 26.8: Integrate Refactored Components and Final Optimization

## Impact So Far

### Code Quality Improvements
- âœ… Established consistent design system
- âœ… Type-safe component interfaces
- âœ… Reusable utility functions
- âœ… Clear component documentation

### Developer Experience
- âœ… Single import path for all UI components
- âœ… Consistent API across components
- âœ… Clear usage examples in README
- âœ… TypeScript autocomplete support

### Next Session Recommendations
1. Start with Task 26.3 (BaseDropdown component)
2. Install Storybook for component documentation
3. Begin refactoring existing dropdown components
4. Add unit tests for new components
