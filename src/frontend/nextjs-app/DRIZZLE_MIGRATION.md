# Drizzle ORM Migration

This branch contains the migration from our custom database migration system to Drizzle ORM.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate migrations from schema changes
npm run drizzle:generate

# Run migrations
npm run drizzle:migrate:run

# Open Drizzle Studio (database GUI)
npm run drizzle:studio
```

## What's New

- **Type-safe queries**: All database operations are now fully typed
- **Automatic migrations**: Schema changes generate SQL migrations automatically
- **Better DX**: IntelliSense support for all database operations
- **Performance**: Connection pooling and optimized queries

## Testing

A temporary test table (`tmp_drizzle_test`) has been added to verify the migration system works correctly. This table will be created when migrations run in CI/CD.

```bash
# Test migration process
npm run test:drizzle-migration

# Verify query compatibility
npm run test:drizzle-compat

# Performance comparison
npm run test:drizzle-perf
```
