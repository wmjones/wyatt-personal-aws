# Demand Planning Dashboard Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step approach to implement the Demand Planning Dashboard, breaking down the development process into manageable phases.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)

### Project Structure and Configuration

1. Create a new route for the demand planning dashboard at `/app/demand-planning/`
2. Set up TypeScript interfaces and types based on `data-structures.md`

4. Create CSS variables in globals.css for the design system
5. Set up the basic layout components

### Core Layout Components

1. Create DashboardLayout component with sidebar and main content area
2. Implement responsive behavior (sidebar collapsible on mobile)
3. Create Header component with logo, time period selector, and user menu
4. Set up TabNavigation component for switching between views
5. Create Footer component with basic information

## Phase 2: Hierarchical Selection (Week 2)

### Hierarchy Components

1. Implement HierarchyTypeSelector component for switching hierarchy types
2. Create HierarchyTree component with expandable/collapsible nodes
3. Implement multi-selection functionality with checkboxes
4. Add search and filter capabilities for hierarchy items
5. Create SelectedHierarchyTags component to display selected items

### Hierarchy Data Management

1. Create hierarchy context with React Context API
2. Implement API integration to fetch hierarchy data
3. Set up state management for hierarchy selections
4. Create utility functions for hierarchy data manipulation
5. Add persistence for user selections (local storage or API)

## Phase 3: Data Visualization (Week 3)

### Chart Components

1. Create base D3Chart component for reusability
2. Implement TimeSeriesChart component for forecast trends
3. Create ComparisonChart component for baseline vs. adjusted comparison
4. Add interactive elements (tooltips, hover states, etc.)
5. Implement responsive design for all visualization components

### Data Integration

1. Create forecast context to manage forecast data
2. Implement API integration for fetching forecast data
3. Set up data transformation utilities for chart components
4. Create mock API responses for development and testing
5. Add loading states and error handling for data fetching

## Phase 4: Adjustment Interface (Week 4)

### Adjustment Components

1. Create AdjustmentPanel component with form controls
2. Implement AdjustmentTypeSelector for percentage/absolute selection
3. Add TimeRangeSelector for specifying adjustment periods
4. Create form validation for adjustment inputs
5. Implement UI feedback for adjustment preview

### Adjustment Logic

1. Create adjustment context to manage adjustment state
2. Implement functions to calculate adjusted forecast values
3. Set up API integration for submitting adjustments
4. Create utility functions for handling different adjustment types
5. Add optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback

## Phase 5: History and Audit (Week 5)

### History Components

1. Create AdjustmentHistoryTable component with sorting and pagination
2. Implement FilterControls for filtering history entries
3. Add detailed view for individual adjustment entries
4. Create HistoricalImpactChart to visualize adjustment impacts
5. Implement export functionality for history data

### History Data Management

1. Create history context to manage history state
2. Implement API integration for fetching adjustment history
3. Set up data transformation utilities for history components
4. Add filtering and sorting logic for history entries
5. Implement pagination for large history datasets

## Phase 6: User Experience Enhancements (Week 6)

### Animation and Transitions

1. Add transition effects for tab switching
2. Implement animations for chart updates
3. Add loading indicators and skeleton screens
4. Create smooth transitions for sidebar expand/collapse
5. Implement micro-interactions for better feedback

### Responsive Design Refinement

1. Test and refine mobile layout for all components
2. Optimize touch interactions for mobile users
3. Add gesture support for common operations
4. Ensure all interactions work well on both desktop and mobile
5. Optimize performance on various device types

## Phase 7: Accessibility and Polish (Week 7)

### Accessibility Improvements

1. Audit and fix keyboard navigation issues
2. Add appropriate ARIA labels and roles
3. Ensure sufficient color contrast
4. Test with screen readers and fix issues
5. Implement focus management for modal dialogs

### Final Polish

1. Conduct comprehensive testing across browsers
2. Fix any visual inconsistencies or bugs
3. Optimize performance for large datasets
4. Add final documentation
5. Conduct user testing and implement feedback

## Technical Dependencies

1. D3.js (already installed in the project)
2. Tailwind CSS (already configured)
3. React Context API (built into React)
4. Zod for validation
5. React Testing Library for component tests

## API Endpoints Required

1. `/api/hierarchies?type={hierarchyType}` - Get hierarchy structures
2. `/api/forecasts` - Get forecast data based on selections
3. `/api/adjustments` - Submit forecast adjustments
4. `/api/adjustments/history` - Get adjustment history
5. `/api/time-periods` - Get available time periods

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
2. Component tests for UI components
3. Integration tests for context providers
4. End-to-end tests for key user flows
5. Accessibility testing using automated tools and manual testing

## Deployment Plan

1. Develop on feature branch (`feature/nextjs-design-update`)
2. Set up CI pipeline for automated testing
3. Deploy to staging environment for QA testing
4. Conduct user acceptance testing
5. Deploy to production environment

## Post-Launch Plan

1. Monitor error rates and performance metrics
2. Collect user feedback
3. Identify opportunities for improvement
4. Plan future enhancements based on user needs
5. Create documentation for maintenance and future development
