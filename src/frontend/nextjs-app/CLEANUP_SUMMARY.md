# Old Migration System Cleanup

This cleanup removes the old custom migration system after successful migration to Drizzle ORM.

## Files Removed

### Core Migration System
- `app/lib/migrations.ts` - Custom migration runner (500+ lines)
- `app/lib/__tests__/migrations.test.ts` - Tests for old system

### API Routes
- `app/api/admin/migrate/route.ts` - Old migration endpoint
- `app/api/admin/run-migrations/route.ts` - Duplicate migration endpoint
- `app/api/admin/` - Empty directory removed

### Scripts
- `scripts/run-migrations.ts` - Used old migration runner
- `scripts/migrate-only.ts` - Standalone script with hardcoded SQL
- `scripts/init-database.ts` - Database initialization script
- `scripts/run-api-migration.sh` - Shell script for API migration

## Package.json Updates

### Scripts Updated
- `db:init` → Now uses `npm run drizzle:push`
- `db:migrate` → Now uses `npm run drizzle:migrate:run`

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Removed ~1000+ lines of custom migration code
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Only Drizzle manages migrations now
3. **Type Safety**: All database operations are now type-safe
4. **Better DX**: Automatic migration generation from schema changes
5. **Maintenance**: Less code to maintain and debug

## Migration Commands

### Old System (Removed)
```bash
npm run db:init         # Custom initialization
npm run db:migrate      # Custom migration runner
```

### New System (Drizzle)
```bash
npm run drizzle:generate    # Generate migrations from schema
npm run drizzle:migrate:run # Run migrations
npm run drizzle:push       # Push schema directly (dev)
npm run drizzle:studio     # Visual database browser
```

## Verification

All functionality previously provided by the custom migration system is now handled by Drizzle:
- ✅ Schema creation
- ✅ Migration tracking
- ✅ Rollback support
- ✅ CI/CD integration
- ✅ Multi-environment support
